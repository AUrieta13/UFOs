# UFOs Sightings

## Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to help Dana with her webpage in making it more informative and eye-catching with the dynamic table she previously created. She asked to provide more in-depth analysis of the UFO sightings recorded by allowing the users to filter for multiple criteria at once.

## Results:
To perform a search you must select a certain filter to search UFO sightings. You can fill out each filter to be very specific, or look up just one of the filter like the city to get all of the recorded UFO sightings relating to that city.

For example, if a user was curious to see the UFO sightings only in Texas, they would input "tx" in the "Enter a State" filter. After you enter "tx", all of the sightings from Texas will be listed on the table with a description of each sighting that occurred.

## Summary:
- One drawback of this webpage is that the initial page has all of the sightings listed in the table of data. I feel like this could be overwhelming to the user and somewhat confusing whenever they try to find out what to search by using the filter.
- I would recommend have a drop down menu for each filter so that the user knows what options they have for searching up UFO sightings. I also would recommend that the table of data that is first presented without any filters be reviewed so that not all of the data be displayed on the first page causing a user to scroll down the page for a long period of time.
